# flask-with-db
HHA 504 // Week 4 // Assignment 4 // Part 1

## this repo focuses on connecting a local database manually created by sqlite3 to our flask app. This time, our htmls connect solely to bootstrap. Our scripts folder includes two py scripts that detail the process of creating a database in-house and viewing it locally by connecting to a pandas database (createDB.py and connectDB.py respectively).

## our directory has simplified to just an index or homepage and a patients page where the table is housed.
